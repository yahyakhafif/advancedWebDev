‚úçÔ∏è Technical implementation  
- **Frontend:** React.js SPA, CSS.  
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express REST API, MongoDB for users/styles, JWT-auth.  
- **Recommendations:** Recommendation service using machine learning.  
- **Auth & Security:** OAuth 2.0 for login, JWT tokens for session management, HTTPS enforced.

üöÇ Development process  
- Week 1: Finalized personas, use cases.  
- Week 2: Wireframes ‚Üí React component skeletons ‚Üí API.  
- Week 3: Connected frontend to backend, built CRUD for styles, profile UI.  
- Week 4: Integrated AI stub, end-to-end tests, bug fixes.  
- Week 4: Deployment to staging, internal demo, final tweaks.

‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and future work  
- **Successes:** Clear UI flow, stable CRUD and auth, responsive design.  
- **Challenges:** machine learning integration latency
- **Future:** Full AI recommendation logic.
